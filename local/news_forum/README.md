Moodle News Forum Creation
==========================

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/LafColITS/moodle-local_news_forum.png)](https://api.travis-ci.org/LafColITS/moodle-local_news_forum)

News Forum creates a news forum on course creation. This eliminates the requirement to have the latest news block installed in order to create the forum. This issue is fully described in [MDL-26707](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-26707).

Requirements
------------
- Moodle 2.6 (build 2013111800 or later)

Installation
------------
Copy the news_forum folder into your /local directory and visit your Admin Notification page to complete the installation.

Usage
-----
The plugin has no options; once installed it will create the news forum automatically on course creation. If you later delete the news forum from a course it will **not** be re-created by this plugin.
