### <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Along with the [Ensemble Video Moodle Repository Plugin](https://github.com/ensembleVideo/moodle-repository_ensemble), this plugin
makes it easier for Moodle users to add videos and playlists to content without
having to navigate to Ensemble Video and copy/paste complicated embed codes.  This
plugin filters content to render urls added by the repository plugin as Ensemble Video
embed codes.

In addition to this documentation, also see our [Setup the Moodle Plugin](http://support.ensemblevideo.com/setup-the-moodle-plugin/)
and [Using the Moodle Plugin](http://support.ensemblevideo.com/using-the-moodle-plugin/) support articles.

#### Configuration Settings

##### Ensemble Urls

Optional.  By default this plugin will use the Ensemble URL configured in the
corresponding [repository plugin](https://github.com/ensembleVideo/moodle-repository_ensemble)
instances so, typically, nothing needs to be added here.  In order to render
embed codes this plugin filters content that contains these urls.  If for some
reason, however, any configured Ensemble URL has changed after content has
already been added, you can add entries here to tell the plugin which additional
urls to filter.
